# theAccountingGame

My purpose of creating this repository:  

1.  When I self-learning the CFA, it occurs to me that if it is too abstract I will be far from the reality. 

2.  Rather than going to an accounting institutes, I prefer creating the simulation because of not only the goal of learning CFA but also the goal of being familiar with python and git-hub.

The Description of #theAccountingGame:

1.  To Learn the Financial Reporting and Analysis by simulating the reality in the game.  

2.  In practice, you will have the BalanceSheet, the IncomeStatement and the CashFlowStatement.  

3.  During the simulating game, you will be familiar with the Financial Reporting by doing the accounting work.   

4.  After having the Financial Reporting, you will be familiar with the Analysis by the accounting tools.  

5.  There are mainly three types of roles in game: Individual, Corporate and Government.
